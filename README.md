## Description:

Fruit Fusion is a matching game based on the logic of the popular [2048](https://play2048.co/). This project currently uses the browser's local storage to hold user account information and game data, however, a back-end is underway.

---

## Motivation:

On our drive across Canada; from Alberta to Newfoundland, my spouse and I played many mobile games while passing time in hotels and at pit stops. I wanted to challenge myself to develop a web game on par with some of those we played. Fruit Fusion is the result.

---

## Outcome:

Developing Fruit Fusion provided me with an opportunity to take a deep dive into the React.js library and make use of API features such as React Hooks. Working on this project also helped me better understand concepts such as component-based development, prototyping, and UI/UX design.

## Features:

Users can play as a guest or create their own accounts by selecting a username and password. The ability to add a custom profile photo will also be available once the back-end for this project is complete.

Navigating to the menu, users can choose to start playing the game immediately, or view instructions on how to play. There is also an option in the menu to change the user's settings, which include: turning off the game’s sound effects, toggling dark mode, or using swipe gestures (and hiding game buttons) when playing on a touchscreen device. From the menu, users can also choose to view the leaderboard (currently limited to players using the same browser session), see the app’s about-information, and update their account information.

When users log out, their game progress and setting selections are saved to their account and will be retrieved on the next login.
